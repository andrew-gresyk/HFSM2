# HFSM2: High-Performance Hierarchical Finite State Machine Framework

Header-only heriarchical FSM framework in C++14, with fully statically-defined structure (no dynamic allocations), built with variadic templates.

## Compiler Support

- Visual Studio 14, 15, 16
- GCC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Clang 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

## Documentation

[Old Wiki](https://github.com/andrew-gresyk/HFSM2/wiki/Tutorial) docs are being upgraded and moved to the [New GitBook](https://doc.hfsm.dev/).

In-line comment-based docs is an on-going effort.

## Feature Highlights

- Permissive [MIT License](https://github.com/andrew-gresyk/HFSM2/blob/master/LICENSE)
- Written in widely-supported modern(ish) C++11
- Header-only
- Convenient, minimal boilerplate
- Fully static, no dynamic allocations
- Uses inline-friendly compile-time pylymorphism, no virtual methods were harmed
- Type-safe transitions: `FSM.changeTo<TargetState>()` with optional payloads
- 100% NoUML-compliant
- [Hierarchical](https://github.com/andrew-gresyk/HFSM2/wiki/Transitions-within-Hierarchy), with a selection of composite (sub-machine) and orthogonal regions
- Gamedev-friendly, supports explicit `State::update()`
- Also supports traditional event-based workflow with `State::react()`
- Inspect anything: previous and current transitions, state activation status, and more!
- Game AI-friendly with [Dynamic planning](https://github.com/andrew-gresyk/HFSM2/wiki/Plans) support
- [Utility theory](https://github.com/andrew-gresyk/HFSM2/wiki/Utility-Theory) support (max score and ranked weighted random)
- Scaleable, supports robust state re-use via state injections
- [Serializable](https://doc.hfsm.dev/user-guide/debugging-and-tools/serialization), with activity and transition history support
- [Debug-assisted](https://gresyk.dev/features/2018/01/15/hfsm-magic.html), includes automatic structure and activity visualization API with `#define HFSM_ENABLE_STRUCTURE_REPORT`
- Built-in logging support
